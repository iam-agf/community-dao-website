    "karan": "Hi everyone, I am Karan Patel. Back when the pandemic began, I went full-time in Crypto and since then been doing Community management in our wonderful Cosmos ecosystem. You might know me from different Cosmos project communities like Sifchain, UMEE Network, Persistence, Comdex (Discord), and now in Chihuahua. I manage the respective community chats efficiently every day ensuring proper support/information is delivered swiftly to the users/core team. As you can see I am really passionate about Community management and on top of that, Another area where I excel at is BizDeV aka being a bridge between various projects to facilitate a meaningful dialogue between two or more teams to help forge long-term partnerships. In the past, I have also provided meaningful contribution /support to the various cosmos project teams regarding marketing which has been greatly appreciated by the projects. With that said, my goal will always be to ensure and contribute to Chihuahua, a useless MEME coin project's amazing community reaching new heights. In case of any question please feel free to reach me out.",
    "nick": "My name is Nick Diaz aka Welding. I've been in crypto for 3-4 years. I found cosmos in 2021; It all started IBC tokens like Osmosis, ever since then, I've been in love with the cosmos ecosystem... A little friend came along called HUAHUA, I've been in love with huahua and I'll always adore chihuahua chain. I'm the co-lead of the chihuahua community DAO. Avid supporter of COSMOS. Currently, I work for a couple different teams but my heart belongs to chihuahua.",
    "callisto": "Callisto here. Started in crypto last 2019, took a shot with $ATOM, got the very first airdrop of the ecosystem and now I'm collaborating and working on multiple Cosmos chains providing knowledge and guides to those wanting to explore the network. Was the very few lucky ones to got the 1mil $HUAHUA airdrop and been holding it eversince, been an avid supporter due to the big opportunity and growth it had and was given he chance to work with its own Community DAO along with the devs and validators, biggest opportunity I've had.",
    "jorin": "Here Jorin. I discovered the whole cosmos in March of this year (2022) and never turn back on other ecosystems. You can find me in several chats treating bad people who are rude, but if you need help you can always reach me in telegram, discord or twitter, with the same tag ( cosmo_jorin ). Not much to tell about me, except that I'm good at Math (not meth, psycho) and coding trinkets.",
